Today is Sunday, 25 November 2018. I have decided to make an meaningless update to the README file to practice updating the master using commits.

First Step: Create a branch where changes will be made. This will create a snapshot or duplicate copy of the master as it stands at the exact moment that this branch is made. Follow-on change to the master will not be automatically captured into this new branch, this is why it is called snapshot of the master.

Second Step: Make changes to all files of interest on this branch

Third Step: Commit change to this branch. This is effectively saving your new changes to be officially part of the branch within which you are working.

Forth Step: Now you can test or review the changes you made in your branch. Once you are satisfied with the code, you can move on tot he pull request.

Fifth Step: Create a pull request for you changes to go into the master version of the code. Once you are content that the changes on the branch meet your satisfaction it's time to share you code with your collaborators as a precursor to merging into the master. This, confirming your changes with your collaborators, is done using a pull request. The pull request is the step in the process when the virtual peer review occurs. Others can review your changes and provide comments back such as finding possible coding errors or code style issues. Once this step is the complete, the pull request can be closed since the review is complete.

Sixth Step: Merging your updates into the master. This is where you merge your pull request (all of your changes/updates) into the master.
