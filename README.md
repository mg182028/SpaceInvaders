Our family project.

Today is Sunday, 25 November 2018. I have decided to make an meaningless update to the README file to practice updating the master using commits.

First Step: Create a branch where changes will be made. This will create a snapshot or duplicate copy of the master as it stands at the exact moment that this branch is made. Follow-on change to the master will not be automatically captured into this new branch, this is why it is called snapshot of the master.
Second Step: Make changes to all files of interest on this branch
Third Step: Commit change to this branch. This is effectively saving my new changes to be officially part of the branch within which I am working.
