Our family project.

Today is Sunday, 25 November 2018. I have decided to make an meaningless update to the README file to practice updating the master using commits.

First Step: Create a branch where changes will be made. This will create a snapshot or duplicate copy of the master as it stands at the exact moment that this branch is made. Follow-on change to the master will not be automatically captured into this new branch, this is why it is called snapshot of the master.

Second Step: Make changes to all files of interest on this branch

Third Step: Commit change to this branch. This is effectively saving your new changes to be officially part of the branch within which you are working.

Forth Step: Now you can test or review the changes you made in your branch. You can run code, run tests, have a peer review, and so on.

Fifth Step: Once you are content that the changes on the branch meet your satisfaction and meet all the agreed upon process requirements for quality and such, you can merge into the master. 

Sixth Step: Merging into the master
